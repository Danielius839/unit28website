       Covid-19: What’s the harm of ‘funny’ anti-vaccine memes?
     </h3>
     <p style="color:white;">
       Memes, often in the form of humorous images and videos, are a major part of how people communicate on the internet, but they can also be used to spread disinformation.
       We've been looking at how these memes can present false and misleading information about Covid-19 vaccines, feeding into concerns about their efficacy or safety.

       US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive
     </h3>
     <p style="color:white;">
       Donald Trump's supporters have claimed that thousands of votes were cast in the US election using the names of people who had died.
       "I may be 72," Maria Arredondo from Michigan told us when we called her. "But I'm alive and breathing. My mind is working fine and I'm healthy."
       Maria said she had voted for Joe Biden and was surprised to hear that her name had appeared on a list of supposedly dead voters in the state.
       We spoke to other people in similar situations to that of Maria in Michigan and found similar stories.
       There have been occasions in previous US elections of dead people having apparently voted.
       This could happen through clerical errors or perhaps other family members with similar names voting with their ballots, but Trump supporters have alleged this has happened on a massive scale at this election.
       We set out to find out whether there is evidence for this claim.

     <h3>
       The Kraken: What is it and why has Trump's ex-lawyer released it?
     </h3>
     <p style="color:white;">
       The Kraken is a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies.
       It's also become an internet meme representing a sprawling, unsubstantiated set of claims that purport to outline the case for widespread fraud in the US presidential election.
       Pro-Trump groups including QAnon conspiracy theorists have amplified the idea under the hashtag #ReleaseTheKraken, and it's being widely shared by those supporting the legal campaign to challenge the election results.

       Boris Johnson flounders as he fails to defend Tories’ fake factchecker at manifesto launch
     </h3>
     <p style="color:white;">
       Boris Johnson was left floundering at today’s Conservative manifesto launch as he failed to defend the party over its “fake news” Twitter scandal.
       The prime minister was knocked off his stride at the launch event in Telford by a question on the scandal, which he claimed not to have followed.
       For a few moments, his normally confident and fluent speaking style dried up as he struggled to find a response.
       After an few sentences peppered with ums and ers, he finally recovered his flow by diverting the conversation onto one of his well-worn routines about Jeremy Corbyn’s Brexit stance.
