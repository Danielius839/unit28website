     <h4>
       Fake online Covid claims should be exposed by tech companies, health experts say
     </h4>
     <p style="color:white;">
       Tech companies should be forced to reveal the most viral Covid-19 material online to bring misinformation to the
       surface where it can be refuted, a public health coalition has urged.

       Reset Australia has written to all federal parliamentarians urging the Australian government to mandate “live lists”
       which could even include demographic information of users sharing fake news about the pandemic.

       It warned February’s vaccination drive could be derailed by “growing distrust” and false online claims.
       The push is supported by the Doherty Institute, Immunisation Coalition and Immunisation Foundation of Australia.

       Tech companies including Google, Facebook and Twitter have opposed reforms that would make them responsible for
       misinformation on their platforms, but the “live list” approach would constitute a lighter touch than mandating the
       material be removed.

     <h4>
       Was coronavirus caused by Chinese people eating bats?
     </h4>
     <p style="color:white;">
       The exact origin of the virus is unknown at this time – although it is thought to have emerged at a seafood market in
       Wuhan, China.
       It is also thought that the first people infected with the new coronavirus contracted it from animals, because coronaviruses
       are known to move from animals to humans.
       A report by the Wuhan Institute for Virology found that the new coronavirus’ genetic makeup was 96 per cent identical
       to the kind found in bats, which were also the original source of SARS.
