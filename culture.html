          Amazon and Facebook staff warned of threats to safety:
        </h4>
        <p style="color:white;">
          Amazon and Facebook have warned staff about threats to their safety amid fears of a backlash against "big tech".
          Amazon Web Services (AWS) employees were told to "be vigilant" after the firm removed Parler from its web-hosting service.
          The app is popular with some supporters of President Donald Trump.
          Facebook staff were also instructed not to wear company-branded clothing in public following its ban of the US President's account.
          The companies cited the deadly siege on US Congress and civil unrest as reasons for concern.
          “In light of recent events, and to err on the side of caution, global security is encouraging
          everyone to avoid wearing or carrying Facebook-branded items at this time,"
          an internal Facebook memo obtained by The Information, said.

            Meet the Elves, Lithuania’s digital citizen army confronting Russian trolls
          </h4>
          <p style="color:white;">
            When the dark acts of the trolls became particularly harmful, the Elves felt they had no choice but to get together and fight back, and the fierce battle which then began has since been waged with no sign of ending.
            Industrial-scale spreading of disinformation; manipulating elections; undermining democratic institutions; orchestrating racial and sectarian strife have become potent weapons of modern hybrid warfare.
            Lithuania is along the frontline in this conflict between Russia and the west. The European Union’s Cyber Rapid Response Force has its headquarters in the country and the region, with the other Baltic states, is a focal point for Nato strategy.
